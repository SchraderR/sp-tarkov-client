# Contributing

Thanks for being interested in our project! All contributions are welcome. If you're unsure where to start, please begin by checking the GitHub issues.

## Workflow

### Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork
3. Make/check out a new branch for your feature or bug fix

### Branches

1. Always create your branch off of the current milestone branch or master.
2. Use a descriptive name for your branch:

##### good
`git checkout -b feature/add-new-feature-of-something`

##### bad
`git checkout -b update`

## Commits

1. Make meaningful commit messages so that the change history is understandable.

Pull Requests

1. Make sure your PR is from your feature branch to the current milestone branch in this repository.
2. Add a clear and concise description of what the PR is about (including the relevant issue numbers).

## Workflow Tips

- Check for existing features: Before you begin, check if someone else is already working on the same thing or if it's a completed feature.
- Create issues: If you see a problem or a missing feature, create an issue. Be sure to include a good description of the issue/feature.
- Create discussions: Larger features should be discussed with the team first. Use GitHub Discussions for these types of changes.

## Don't Forget

Contributing to Open Source should be fun and a positive experience! Enjoy contributing!
